Planning:
My planning process included starting with wireframes for how I envisioned the site to look. This approach helped me get a rough idea of what i needed to build rather than looking at a blank canvas of code I at least had a starting point for my 'index.html'. After this I started developing user stories. These helped me understand, from a user perspective, what I needed to build into my user interface eventually. I like this approach because it helps you think deductively to help identify what reverse engineering would need to take place in order to establish code to perform said interface. From there I started writing Pseudocode. This pseudocode included a wide range of subjects, but I tried to break down the functionality I would need to write bit by bit.

Story about Development Process:
I started with an overall html layout that would allow me to start plugging in the overal functionality the user would interface with and allow me to begin testing my code. Once this was established I was able to start writing game-logic that would be used later. I then worked on the CRUD with AJAX requests. This was an iterative process of changing simple features until the code successfully, read, created, patched, and deleted certain requests. Then I started integrating the game-logic into the game-board. This allowed the user to 'click' on game-board pieces that would then operate as events. To do this I set up event listeners that would provide functions and methods which passed information to and from the game api. I also created these for the user api to allow simply sign-up, sign-in, change-password, and sign-out capabilities. Once my basic events, api, and ui worked I started making the application more astheticly pleasing and fun to work with.

Problem solving strategy:
My problem solving strategy including discussing issues with classmates to obtain new perspectives on certain issues. I also talked to myself about what my code was doing, sometimes out-loud just to listen to the process logic to see if it made sense and to simplify the process to debug, or refactor. I also opened up issues in the issue que with our WDI instructor team. Another thing that helped tremendously through the process was to log on the console  and use debugger in certain lines to see what information was showing on the DOM. This helped me better understand what my code was doing and where successes and failures were.

Unsolved problems for future iterations:
I plan to include more detail in the game/user data and make beautify the application and improve the ui.

Lessons Learned:
Overall, I learned a plethora of lessons. One I learned later in my planning is that I needed to go into even further detail with my pseudocode. Other lessons learned were the importance of taking care of one problem at a time. By trying to observe "the whole elephant", if you will, I was daunted by the larger task at hand instead of taking one bite at a time.
